% TS2MEANS Time series 2-means clustering
%    IDX = TS2MEANS( X, DT, [WDURATIONMIN WDURATIONMAX], WINCREMENT, 
%    WOVERLAP, BIAS) performs a dynamic weighted two-means clustering on 
%    the time series X, which is assumed to be uniformly sampled with time
%    interval DT seconds. The algorithm determines the clusters at every 
%    instant of time T by assigning the samples in the neighborhood of T to
%    the classes, using as optimization criteria the maximization of the 
%    distance between the centroids. The analysis is performed at different
%    scales by using window sizes that increase by a factor of WSINCREMENT 
%    (greater than 1). The minimum and maximum window durations (in 
%    seconds) are determined by WDURATIONMIN and WDURATIONMAX. The windows
%    are uniformly distributed over time with an overlap factor of WOVERLAP
%    (between 0 and 1). 
%
%    A postprocessing step is performed to avoid an undesirable situation
%    that sometimes occur when the value of the samples is close to the 
%    midpoint between the centroids: A block of samples is assigned to 
%    class 0 (the class normally associated to lower centroids) but the 
%    block is completely above a neighboring block assigned to class 1 
%    (the class normally associated to higher centroids), or vice versa. 
%    This situation is avoided by relabeling one of the blocks with the 
%    label of the other: If BIAS equals ?max? then class-0 blocks are 
%    relabeled as class-1 blocks, and if BIAS equals ?min? then it is done
%    the other way around.
%
%    IDX = TS2MEANS( X ) uses the default parameters: DT = 1 s, 
%    WDURATIONMIN = 0 s, WDURATIONMAX = duration of the time series, 
%    WINCREMENT = 2^1/2, WOVERLAP = 0.5, BIAS = ?max? if before the 
%    postprocessing the most populated class in IDX is class 1, and 
%    BIAS = ?min? if the most populad teclass is class 0.
%
%    IDX = TS2MEANS( X,...,[],... ) uses the default value for the 
%    parameter replaced with the placeholder [].
%
%    REMARKS: For better results, make WOVERLAP as large as possible and
%    WINCREMENT as small as possible. However, take into account that the
%    computational complexity of the algorithm is inversely proportional to
%    1-WOVERLAP and inversely proportional to the logarithm of WINCREMENT.
%    The default values have been found to produce empirically good 
%    results.
